				My name is Rory Haggart. I'm a student at The University of Sheffield, and I am studying for an MEng in Aerospace Engineering. I've taken the route of <i>avionics</i>, though throughout my studies, I've felt that electronics has been a weak point of mine. In combination with my hobby of playing guitar, and my interest in some of the crazy sounds we can make with effects pedals, it seemed like a really worthwhile venture to learn more about how effects pedals work and try to build some for myself!
			</p>
			<p>
				I started this guide in response to some of the struggles that I was having. I was having a hard time collecting the full set of information that would be useful in the designing and building of pedals, and often it seemed like the documentation that I could find would just say '<i>we do this because it's convention</i>', or '<i>this is important because it's important</i>'... Stressful.
			</p>

				So now that you know that I'm really just a beginner, I invite you to please correct me when I inevitably make mistakes. I really want to learn as much as I can about this, and any help from those more knowledgeable is greatly appreciated! Additionally, if you have any feedback or questions, I'd love to hear them and I will do my best to get back to you as quickly as possible, and hopefully with a satisfactory response.
