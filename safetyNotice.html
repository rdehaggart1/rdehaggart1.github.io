				<h3>Safety Notice</h3>
				<p>
					Whilst effects pedals are low-power circuits (expect 9 to 24V with low current levels), and the risk is <i>relatively</i> low, it's crucial that you are careful when working 
					with <i>any</i> electronic circuits. Incorrect <a href = "importantConcepts.html#grounding" target = "_blank">grounding</a>, for example, 
					can introduce a serious shock risk, and in all cases, you should check, double check, and triple check your circuits before you start 
					using them.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Whenever your effect is plugged in and switched on, <i>do not</i> touch any part of the circuitry that isn't designed to be touched. Even 
					a small shock can be uncomfortable and could leave you susceptible to other risks, like tripping. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Care should also be taken when <a href = "componentsAndTools.html#solderingEquipment" target = "_blank">soldering</a>. Make sure you are 
					in a well ventilated environment and wearing appropriate PPE (i.e. safety goggles). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Please refer to the relevant user manuals and documentation for the tools and components that you are using, and make sure you are familiar
					with the risks associated with them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					With that out of the way, lets get going!
