			<h3>Basic Overdrive Pedal</h3>
			<p>
				Now we'll look at how to construct a 'basic' overdrive pedal. There's nothing particularly fancy or special about this pedal, but it will
				function as a nice overdrive with some good tunability.
			</p>
			<p>
				We'll start things nice and simple, looking at an overdrive circuit with one control (<i>gain</i>), and no 'on/off' switch. Clearly this isn't
				much use - if you decide you dont want overdrive, it's a bit annoying to have to lean down and twist your gain control to minimum... However,
				this way we can start off simple, then make some mods to give it some more functionality.

					<h5>The input stage</h5>
					<p>
						We're using a single, \(9V\) battery to power this pedal. This supply is used for the <i>operational amplifier</i>, an active
						component. The op-amp can therefore output any voltage between \(0V\) and \(9V\). Our input is centred around
						\(0V\), so in our 'perfect sine wave' simplification of the audio signal, half of our signal is at a voltage below \(0V\). If our
						op-amp tries to amplify a negative voltage, it won't be able to, since the output can't go below the negative supply (\(0V\)).
					</p>
					<p>
						It's simple enough to get around this, though! If we 'shift' our input signal so that it's no longer centred around \(0V\), but 
						is instead centred around \(4.5V\), we can take advantage of the full op-amp output range. This 'shift' is known as a 
						<a href = "importantConcepts.html#DCBiasing" target = "_blank">DC bias</a>. As we're using a battery, rather than a wall-wart
						supply for this pedal, we can use a slightly simpler circuit, as batteries aren't as noisy as wall supplies.
					</p>
					<p>
						CIRCUIT
					</p>
					<p>
						Looks nice and easy, right? Let's have a quick chat about whats going on here.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i> form a <a href = "importantConcepts.html#voltageDividers" target = "_blank">voltage divider</a>. Each resistor
						is the same size (\(1M\Omega\)), and so the voltage drop across each of the two resistors is the same: \({9V \over 2}=4.5V\).
