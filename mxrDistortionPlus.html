				<h3>Dissecting the <i>MXR Distortion+</i></h3>
				<p>
					Now we're getting somewhere. We have some understanding of how components are used to achieve particular functions, and we should probably illustrate this in a real example. The <i><a href = "https://www.jimdunlop.com/mxr-distortion/" target = "_blank">MXR Distortion+</a></i> is a distortion pedal (<i>duh</i>). 
				</p>
				<h4>What is Distortion?</h4>
				<p>
					Distortion is the blanket term given to <i>overdrive</i>, <i>distortion</i>, <i>crunch</i>, <i>fuzz</i>, and other similar effects. <b>It is characterised by the 'clipping' of the audio wave peaks and troughs</b>. Distortion was originally achieved by pushing the amplifier beyond its design limits - turning the gain way up so that the amplifier is trying to output a voltage higher than it is designed for. The voltage output then 'saturates' and clips the tops and bottoms of the signal to this maximum output level. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Distortion was originally achieved using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_amplifier" target = "_blank">tube (or valve) amplifiers</a>, but most amplifiers manufactured today use <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_amplifier#Solid-state" target = "_blank">semiconductor (solid-state)</a> devices to amplify the signal. There will always be a debate about whether or not tube amplifiers are superior to semiconductors, and really it all comes down to personal preference. Tubes aren't so commonplace these days and are often expensive and tricky to work into a small circuit like the ones we're looking at, so whilst tube distortion pedals <a href = "https://shop.fender.com/en-GB/effects-pedals/boost-gain/mtg-tube-distortion-pedal/0234539000.html?rl=en_US" target = "_blank">do exist</a>, we'll focus on solid-state pedals like this one.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clipping can either be <i>hard</i> (typical of solid-state circuits) or <i>soft</i> (typical of tube circuits).
