				<h3>Dissecting the <i>MXR Distortion+</i></h3>
				<p>
					Now we're getting somewhere. We have some understanding of how components are used to achieve particular functions, and we should probably illustrate this in a real example. The <i><a href = "https://www.jimdunlop.com/mxr-distortion/" target = "_blank">MXR Distortion+</a></i> is a distortion pedal (<i>shock</i>), and is quite a neat example of all we've learned so far. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It's not <i>completely</i> necessary to understand how a distortion effect works at this stage, as we're mostly interested in the function of each of the components here, rather than what the pedal is actually doing. However, we will cover <a href = "distortion.html" target = "_blank">how distortion works</a> in a separate page later on.

					<p>
						This version of the circuit includes some modifications (indicated with dotted connections), and doesn't include true-bypass switching.
					</p>
					<p>
					<i>R1</i> is a <a href = "importantConcepts.html#pullDownResistors" target = "_blank">pull down resistor</a>. In the image, the effect 
						is in it's <i>on</i> state (see the switch at the bottom right of the image). When the circuit is switched <i>off</i>, the input signal 
						goes straight to the output (as this isn't a true bypass circuit, some of the signal will also make it's way into the effect). Whilst 
						bypassed, capacitor <i>C2</i> will begin to charge up on the outboard side due to the leakage current pushed through by the biasing 
						voltage. Resistor <i>R1</i> provides a path to ground for the leakage current to prevent it from charging <i>C2</i>. <i>R1</i> is also 
						large enough that it won't significantly affect the signal when the effect is <i>on</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>R2</i> and <i>R3</i> form a <a href = "importantConcepts.html#voltageDividers" target = "_blank">potential divider</a>, and create 
						a <a href = "importantConcepts.html#DCBiasing", target = "blank">DC bias voltage</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>C2</i> is a <a href = "importantConcepts.html#couplingCapacitors" target = "_blank">coupling capacitor</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>C1</i> is a power supply <a href = "importantConcepts.html#smoothingCapacitors" target = "_blank">smoothing capacitor</a>, and is 
						required because this is a <i>real</i> circuit, connected to a <i>real</i> power supply.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>R4</i> complicated
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>R5</i> is a <a href = "importantConcepts.html#currentLimitingResistors" target = "_blank">current limiting resistor</a>, that will 
						protect the sensetive operational amplifier from electro-static discharge (ESD). If the guitar lead is plugged in to the pedal but is 
						left disconnected at the other end, a static charge could build up on the plug ... 
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>C3</i> forms a <a href = "importantConcepts.html#frequencyFilters" target = "_blank">low-pass filter</a> in combination with the 
						source impedance. This acts to reduce high frequency noise on the input.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<i>R6</i>, <i>R7</i>, and <i>R8</i> define the gain of this non-inverting op-amp configuration.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>C4</i> keeps the inverting input centred around the 4.5V bias. Without it, the DC bias would be amplified too, so the supply rails 
						would end up clipping our signal.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>C6</i> removes our DC bias from the output signal, so the pedal output is centred around \(0V\), like the input.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>D1</i> and <i>D2</i> clip the signal to produce the 'overdrive' effect
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>R9</i> limits the current through the diodes (and seems to make the response symmetric?)
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>C7</i> is a filter to remove high frequency noise from the output.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>R10</i> controls the volume
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>D3</i> is an 'on' indicator LED
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>R11</i> is a current limiting resistor to protect <i>D3</i>, the indicator LED
