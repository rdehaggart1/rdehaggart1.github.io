				<h3>Dissecting the <i>MXR Distortion+</i></h3>
				<p>
					Now we're getting somewhere. We have some understanding of how components are used to achieve particular functions, and we should probably illustrate this in a real example. The <i><a href = "https://www.jimdunlop.com/mxr-distortion/" target = "_blank">MXR Distortion+</a></i> is a distortion pedal (<i>shock</i>), and is quite a neat example of all we've learned so far. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It's not <i>completely</i> necessary to understand how a distortion effect works at this stage, as we're mostly interested in the function of each of the components here, rather than what the pedal is actually doing. However, we will cover <a href = "distortion.html" target = "_blank">how distortion works</a> in a separate page later on.

If the guitar lead is plugged in to the pedal but is left disconnected at the other end, a static charge could build up on the plug ... </p>
					<p><i>C3</i> forms a <a href = "importantConcepts.html#frequencyFilters" target = "_blank">low-pass filter</a> in combination with the source impedance. This acts to reduce high frequency noise on the input.</p>
