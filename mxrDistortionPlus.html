				<h3>Dissecting the <i>MXR Distortion+</i></h3>
				<p>
					Now we're getting somewhere. We have some understanding of how components are used to achieve particular functions, and we should probably illustrate this in a real example. The <i><a href = "https://www.jimdunlop.com/mxr-distortion/" target = "_blank">MXR Distortion+</a></i> is a distortion pedal (<i>shock</i>). 
				</p>
				<h4>What is Distortion?</h4>
				<p>
					Distortion is the blanket term given to <i>overdrive</i>, <i>distortion</i>, <i>crunch</i>, <i>fuzz</i>, and other similar effects. <b>It is characterised by the 'clipping' of the audio wave peaks and troughs</b>. Distortion was originally achieved by pushing the amplifier beyond its design limits - turning the gain way up so that the amplifier is trying to output a voltage higher than it is capable of. The voltage output then 'saturates' and clips the tops and bottoms of the signal to this maximum output level. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially the tubes in a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_amplifier" target = "_blank">tube (or valve) amplifier</a> were overdriven to distort the signal, but most amplifiers manufactured today use <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_amplifier#Solid-state" target = "_blank">semiconductor (solid-state)</a> devices to amplify the signal, and myriad dedicated distortion effects pedals exist to distort the signal with much more flexibility and control than just whacking the gain up to its maximum. There will always be a debate about whether or not tube distortion is superior to the solid-state distortion we frequently see today, and really it all comes down to personal preference. Tubes aren't so commonplace these days and are often expensive and tricky to work into a small circuit like the ones we're looking at, so whilst tube distortion pedals <a href = "https://shop.fender.com/en-GB/effects-pedals/boost-gain/mtg-tube-distortion-pedal/0234539000.html?rl=en_US" target = "_blank">do exist</a>, we'll focus on solid-state pedals like the <i>MXR Distortion+</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clipping can either be <i>hard</i> (typical of solid-state circuits) or <i>soft</i> (typical of tube circuits). We can see the (admittedly quite subtle) difference in the below plots and audio clips.
