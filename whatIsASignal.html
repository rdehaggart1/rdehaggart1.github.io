				<h3>What is a Signal?</h3>
				<p>
					First things first: <b>a ‘signal’ is a voltage</b>, and it is the output from your guitar - this is important to understand. This signal 
					carries the information about what you’re playing and how you’re playing it. The signal is manipulated by the circuitry inside the guitar, 
					then by the circuitry of the effects pedal(s), and then again by the amplifier. Finally, it is output as a sound wave by the loudspeaker. 
					At a very high level, everything from plucking an electric guitar string, to some (hopefully expected) sound coming out of the loudspeaker 
					is relatively simple. To keep a lid on things, we’ll make some simplifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					The need-to-know points are as follows:
					<ul>
						<li><b>When you ‘pluck’ a guitar string, you induce a 'back and forth' vibration on the string</b>.</li>
						<li>As the string is vibrating, it pushes nearby air molecules back and forth too, and so sets up a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_wave#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20a%20transverse%20wave,other%20end%20up%20and%20down." target = "_blank">
						transverse pressure wave</a> through the air that we can hear, even when the guitar is unplugged. At this point we can hear the guitar
						making a noise by itself, but we need to convert the vibration of the string into an electrical signal aswell, so that we can 
						pass it into our circuitry.</li>
						<li>Enter, pickups. Pickups convert the vibrations of the guitar strings into an audio signal. This might sound like magic, depending on how familiar 
						you are with electromagnetic induction. What you need to know is that <b>as a string vibrates over the pickup, an alternating voltage 
						is created in the guitar circuitry, and this voltage is an electrical representation of the note you’ve just played</b>. The 
						voltage is a sinusoidal oscillation with a frequency equal to the frequency of the guitar string vibration, and an amplitude that 
						relates to how ‘hard’ the string is vibrating [see appendix for detailed explanation – amplitude relates to speed (faraday/lenz) and 
						if amplitude of vibration is higher, speed of nodes is higher at centre point].</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Below is an illustration of the basic principle. As the string oscillates back and forth, so too does the voltage induced in the pickups. 
					A full understanding of this concept is not necessary. It has been presented here for completeness as we paint the picture of what causes 
					the input to our pedals
