				<h3>Components and Tools</h3>
				<p>
					Before you can start putting your own pedals together, you'll need some components! This page will help guide you through some of the most 
					important components, what they're used for, and where to find them. After we've talked about the components, we'll touch on some tools - 
					most of which are optional - that might help in one way or another, depending on your intentions and your level of interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the top of each section there will be a brief summary that indicates how much you can expect each item to cost, how important it is,
					and a link to somewhere that you can consider buying each item from.

							More important than any other component is the jack socket. Now that's no fun! Well yes, that's true, but if you can't connect in 
							to your nice fancy boutique pedal with a load of clever circuitry and a pretty enclosure, it won't do a damn thing!
						</p>
						<p>
							Jack plugs and sockets are pretty unremarkable. They just provide a mechanism to pass the audio signal into the pedal circuitry. 
							The plug/socket combos we're interested in are \(6.35mm\) (\({1 \over 4} inch\)) in diameter. They come in two flavours: 
							<i>mono</i> (also known as <i>2-pole</i> or <i>TS</i>), and <i>stereo</i> (<i>3-pole</i> or <i>TRS</i>). You might already know 
							that <i>mono</i> means that our audio signal has a single channel (if you listened to it through a pair of headphones, both ears 
							would be hearing the same single track), and <i>stereo</i> means there are two channels (each ear would hear its own track). 
							<b>Most standard guitar cables and connecters are <i>mono</i> and so we'll focus on this variety</b>. <i>Note: there are some 
							<a href = "http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/pdf/ggg_sw_battery.pdf" target = "_blank">interesting</a> ways to make use of a 
							TRS socket, even with a mono plug!</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							The image below illustrates the difference between a 2-pole and 3-pole jack. These names come from the number of conductors on the 
							jack plug, where each conductor is separated by a slice of insulation (the black lines on the plug). <b>The <i>Tip</i> and the 
							<i>Ring</i> conductors carry the audio signal</b> through our effects loop - they are the 'hot' connections. <b>The <i>Sleeve</i> 
							is connected to <i>ground</i></b> in each circuit. If you imagine we had an AC signal generator, we could connect the positive 
							terminal to the <i>Tip</i> and the negative terminal to the <i>Sleeve</i> of a mono jack-socket, and then plug our lead in and 
							feed this signal out to some other circuit.
						</p>
						<p>
							We'll look at how to wire a jack-socket up in our first pedal circuit.

						<p>
							Again, a little dull... sorry. We'll get to the <i>actual</i> components soon enough. But of course, without wires, you're not 
							going to get very far, so we should touch on them quickly.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the world of electronics, there really are a <i>bunch</i> of different types of wires. Luckily for our application, we can 
							focus on just one or two. Wires can either be <i>single-core</i> or <i>multi-core</i>. In both of these varieties, the cores can 
							contain <i>solid</i> or <i>stranded</i> conductors. <b>We'll be working with <i>single-core</i> wires with a <i>solid</i> 
							conductor core</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							We don't need <i>multi-core</i> wire as we're just passing one signal around a small circuit. We're using a <i>solid</i> conductor 
							core becuase it's far easier to use with our prototyping boards (it's the difference between trying to thread an old, frayed 
							shoelace; or a brand new one with the aglet still intact). <i>Stranded</i> core wires are much more flexible, and so less likely 
							to fracture, but this isn't an application that demands flexibility so we can deal with a more rigid wire. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The diameter of the conductor and the total diameter of the wire (including insulation) are variable, and you can find out more 
							about the American Wire Gauge (AWG) standard 
							<a href = "https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wire-gauges-d_419.html" target = "_blank">here</a>. <b>We're most interested in 
							AWG 20 to AWG 24</b> - these fit snugly into the holes in our prototyping boards, and the current ratings are way higher than we 
							will need.

							<br>Different applications require different resistances, but there are some common sizes that see a lot of use, and so it may be

						<p>
							Wow! Actual components! Alright calm down, they're just resistors... That said, they are perhaps the most common components in all 
							electrical applications. Every circuit that we look at will contain resistors (or <a href = "#potentiometers">potentiometers</a> - 
							a type of resistor).
						</p>
						<p>
							A quick refresher: resistors resist the flow of current. Voltage is the force that 'pushes' current around our circuits. If we 
							impose several restrictions on this flow in the form of resistors, more of that pushing force is going to be 'used up' to overcome 
							the 'tighter' restrictions - this is what is called the 'voltage drop', or the voltage between the legs of a component. You might 
							be familiar with <i>Ohm's Law</i>, \(V=I \times R\), which simply states that the voltage difference, \(V\) across the two legs of 
							a resistor is directly proportional to the current flow \(I\) through the resistor, with the resistance \(R\) being the constant 
							of proportionality.
						</p>
						<p>
							Resistors convert electrical energy to heat. This might seem undesirable, but we can use resistors as tools to manipulate our 
							signal in some really useful ways. We'll see resistors used for several purposes - some of which will be covered in detail on the 
							<a href = "importantConcepts.html" target = "_blank">'Important Concepts'</a> page. <b>In a typical circuit, we might see 
							resistors used as <i>voltage dividers</i>, <i>pull-down resistors</i>, <i>current-limiting resistors</i> or <i>frequency 
							filters</i></b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Resistors come in all sorts of sizes (see the below <i>resistor colour chart</i>). This is where we start seeing the opportunity 
							for experimentation. With each of the circuits we look at, it's worth trying to swap some resistors out for different sizes, and 
							seeing what affect that has on the output.

							is a good starting point. <br>Again, pots come in a range of sizes and packages, but in pedal applications we'll most commonly see

							A potentiometer is a variable <a href = "#resistors">resistor</a> - you might hear them called <i>pots</i> for short. They should 
							be quite familiar to you - those knobs on your guitar that control volume and tone are potentiometers! You might also hear them 
							called <i>variable resistors</i>, because that's really what they are. 
						</p>
						<p>
							A <i>potentiometer</i> is a resistor with three legs, and has a dial to control the resistance between each of the legs. The 
							<i>potentiometers</i> symbol paints the picture quite nicely:

						<figure id = "potentiometerSymbol">
							<img src = "figures/potentiometerSymbol.png" alt = "the electronic symbol for a potentiometer"></img>
							<figcaption>The electronic symbol for a potentiometer</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Legs <i>1</i> and <i>3</i> of the potentiometer in this symbol are just like a normal resistor. Leg <i>2</i> is connected to a 
							wiper that can move across the resistor. This means that the resistance is split in two - there's one resistance between legs 
							<i>1</i> and <i>2</i>, and another between legs <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>. So if we had a \(250k\Omega\) potentiometer, and the middle 
							leg was \({1 \over 4}\) of the way from leg <i>1</i>, we could represent the circuit using two separate resistors, like this:

							Breadboard is a <i>really</i> useful piece of kit. It's a prototyping board that allows you to quickly commit a design to 
							hardware, but without any tricky soldering. Breadboard works very simply - it's a plastic board full of holes, with strips of 
							conducting material under the holes. You just slip your components in the holes and you're good to go! This makes it very easy to

								This is where things start getting more optional.
							</p>
							<p>
								To fit your wires into breadboard/stripboard, and to have the wires function as they should, you'll need to strip the 
								insulation off the ends to expose the conductor underneath. Wire strippers also allow you to cut lengths of wire that are more 
								managable than \(10m\) coils... That's really all there is to it! 
							</p>
							<p>
								They really do make your life a lot easier, so depending on your plans, it might be worth splashing out ~£15-£30 on a decent 
								set - something like <a href = "https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/wire-strippers/0613044/" target = "_blank">this</a> should do 
								the trick nicely!
