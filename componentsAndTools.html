				<h3>Components and Tools</h3>
				<p>
					Before you can start putting your own pedals together, you'll need some components! This page will help guide you through some of the most important components, what they're used for, and where to find them. 
				</p>
				<h4>Components</h4>
				<h5>Jack Sockets</h5>
				<p>
					More important than any other component is the jack socket. <b>Boring</b>, yes. You can wire up a nice fancy boutique pedal with a load of clever circuitry and a pretty enclosure, but it won't do a damn thing if you can plug it in to anything!
				</p>
				<p>
					Jack plugs and sockets are pretty unremarkable. They just provide a mechanism to pass the audio signal into the pedal circuitry. The plug/socket combos we're interested in are \(6.35mm\) (\({1 \over 4} inch\)) in diameter. They come in two flavours: <i>mono</i> (also known as <i>2-pole</i> or <i>TS</i>), and <i>stereo</i> (<i>3-pole</i> or <i>TRS</i>). You might already know that <i>mono</i> means that our audio signal has a single channel (if you listened to it through a pair of headphones, both ears would be hearing the same single track), and stereo means there are two channels (each ear would hear its own track). Most standard guitar cables and connecters are <i>mono</i> and so we'll focus on those throughout.

				<h5>Wires</h5>
				<p>
					Again, a little dull... sorry. We'll get to the <i>actual</i> components soon enough. But of course, without wires, you're not going to get very far, so we should touch on them quickly.
