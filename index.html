				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					Guitar effects pedals can be a ‘black box’ to many that use them - especially if you’ve never been exposed to (or simply don’t care about) electronic circuits. For one reason or another, however, you’ve decided that you want to know how they work, how to use them, or how to make them. To this end, I have put together this guide in the hopes that it might kickstart your learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been documenting things as I’ve been learning them myself, and so I hope this becomes a useful tool from the perspective of a fellow beginner! We’ll have a look at how pedals manipulate the output signal from your guitar, what happens when you twist the knobs and flip the switches, and how to design and build your own pedals from scratch.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, a guide is made to be followed, but I highly encourage you taking some time to experiment. I will talk you through concepts, circuits, and sounds, but at the end of the day, you know what you’re looking for better than I do. Once you understand how the components are interacting with one another, and with your guitar, you should be able to tailor the pedals you pick or the pedals you make to achieve a sound that you’re proud of.
					I want to clarify that I will be assuming a certain level of understanding throughout this guide. This guide should be suited to you if you have a basic understanding of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Electrical circuit schematics and symbols</li>
						<li>Fundamental electronics concepts (voltage, current, resistance...)</li>
						<li>Basic wave theory (frequency, period, amplitude...)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					If you feel that you aren’t so comfortable in some of these areas, I’d recommend familiarising yourself before moving forwards. Check out the <a href = "usefulOnlineResources.html">Useful Online Resources</a> section for some guidance.
					Now as a quick disclaimer - I’m no expert. I’m itching to learn more about all of this, and I’d love to learn alongside you! If you have any questions, corrections, improvements, jokes: please send them my way at <a href="mailto:rdeh10@googlemail.com" target="_blank">rdeh10@googlemail.com</a>. I’d be very happy to hear from you!
