				<h3>Important Concepts</h3>
				<p>
					Whilst this guide assumes a certain level of knowledge, there are some fundamental concepts that are really common and important in guitar effects pedals, and it's worth making sure we're all on the same page.

					<h4>Grounding</h4>
					<p style = "text-align: center">
						<b>Correctly grounding your circuits is important. Incorrect grounding can create a shock hazard. Please check your circuits thoroughly to make sure the grounding is adequate</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You're plugged in and ready to go, but there's an annoying buzzing noise that stops when you touch a metal part on the guitar body. If your parents paid extra to install that spectrum analyser in their child as the kind doctor recommended, you'll know that it's a \(50Hz\) or \(60Hz\) buzz. That's a <i>grounding issue</i>, my friend. What it means is that you have what's called a <i>ground loop</i> - when two parts of a circuit are supposed to be at the same electrical potential (\(0V\) in this case), but they're not. Often, audio equipment that is connected to the mains (an amplifier or effects pedal) will share the signal ground with the mains ground, and this means that the ground loop will actually pull the 'mains hum' into the signal, and amplify it (buzzzzz).
					</p>
					<p>
						Grounding issues are pretty easy to avoid, however. If ground is just a point with zero electrical potential, we just need to find something conductive with (theoretically) zero electrical potential that will not easily charge to some non-zero potential once current starts flowing in the circuit. It turns out that really any conveniently placed decent-sized solid peices of metal will do the trick nicely. For example, let's take a look inside a guitar for a second:
					</p>
					<figure id = "grounding">
						<img src = "figures/grounding.png" alt = "grounding inside a guitar"></img>
						<figcaption>The electronics cavity of a guitar, with the grounding highlighted</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						In circle (\(A.\)), you'll see the blob of solder on the metallic body of the tone potentiometer, which is connecting several grounding wires from the circuit. In circle (\(B.\)), you can see a wire that has travelled from the electronics cavity and reappeared in the tremelo cavity, and is soldered directly onto the spring claw. Both of these methods are as discussed above - <b>connect the circuit ground to large pieces of metal that will not easily increase their potential once current begins to flow</b>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In our circuits, potentiometers will be fairly common, and so we'll use those where possible. If we house our pedals in metal enclosures, we can connect to our chassis for grounding. If neither of these options are available, we should still be ok. We're still connected to the amplifier and the guitar grounds via the jack sockets and the jack plug <i>Sleeve</i> connections, and so as long as they've been grounded well, we should be alright... Wherever possible though, <b>please properly ground your circuits!!</b>

					<h4>Active or Passive?</h4>
						<p>
							This one is nice and simple. The circuits we'll look at will have both active and passive components. 
						</p>
						<p>
							A passive component is one that will only consume electrical power, and cannot produce any additional power of its own. Typically this just means that it does not have its own power supply (e.g. a resistor or an inductor).
						</p>
						<p>
							An active component has a power supply of its own (see <a href = "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-8/introduction-operational-amplifiers/" target = "_blank">operational amplifiers</a> for example). This means that it can draw power from this supply and 'inject' power into the circuit. The output of an op-amp can be much more powerful than it's input.

				<button class = "collapsible" id = "impedance" onclick = "smoothScroll(document.getElementById('impedance'))">Impedance</button>
				<div class = "collapsibleContent">
					<h4>Impedance</h4>
						<p>
							Hopefully you have a decent grasp of <a href = "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-1/resistance/" target="_blank"><i>resistance</i></a>. <i>Impedance</i> is admittedly a little scarier (remember those imaginary numbers you thought you'd never need...). But for our purposes, the core takeaway is that <b>impedance is the effective resistance of a component to alternating current</b>. Remember how we said the vibration in the guitar string causes an alternating voltage level in your guitar circuitry? Perhaps it's obvious that this alternating voltage force pushes alternating current through the circuit, and so the impedance is a very important thing to understand and quantify. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Impedance is a combination of <i>resistance</i> and <i>reactance</i>. Resistors are our old friends! Of course, <i>resistors</i> are responsible for the <i>resistance</i> component of a circuit's impedance. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Reactance</i> is just a little bit messier. <i>Reactance</i> is the 'effective resistance' that is offered by components like <i>capacitors</i> and <i>inductors</i>. The reason that <i>reactance</i> isn't so friendly is that <b>reactance varies with frequency</b>. Don't worry too much about the maths right now, but it might help your understanding if you look at how a capacitors reactance is defined: \[X_C = {1 \over 2 \times \pi \times f \times C}\]
						</p>
						<p>
							A higher <i>reactance</i>, \(X\), is a higher <i>effective resistance</i>. <b>So for any particular capacitor, (characterised by it's <i>capacitance</i>, \(C\)), the reactance gets higher as the frequency, \(f\), of the alternating current decreases</b>. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If we have a \(10 \mu F\) capacitor (thats \({10 \over 1,000,000} F\)), then at the height of the human hearing range - \(20kHz\) - the reactance will be \(X_C \approx 0.8 \Omega \) - we could almost pretend the capacitor is just a bit of wire!
						</p>
						<p>
							A perfect direct current will not vary over time - it has a frequency of \(f=0Hz\). If we put this into our reactance equation, we get a divide-by-zero error (whoops!), but we can say that the reactance is essentially infinite for a direct current, as if there is an open circuit where the capacitor is - <b>a capacitor will 'block' direct currents</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Inductors are essentially the opposite in this sense. Their reactance increases as the frequency increases.

					<h4>Source and Load Impedance</h4>
						<p>
							Now that we have some understanding of impedance, we have to touch on a <b>VERY IMPORTANT THING</b>. As well as the impedance that exists all around our pedal circuitry, <b>we must also consider what is happening at the output of our guitar, and at the input of out amplifier!!!</b>

					<h4>Pull-down Resistors</h4>
					<p>
						There's a common phenomenon in guitar effects pedals - an audible <i>pop</i> noise when you un-bypass an effect by stomping it back into it's on state. This is something that's easily avoided by simply adding a resistor just on the inboard side of any switches.
					</p>
					<p>
						As we saw in the <a href = "#impedance">impedance</a> section, a capacitor 'blocks' direct current from flowing through it. This may be true for an ideal capacitor, but in the real world, things aren't so convenient. In reality, a capacitor will actually 'leak' a small amount of direct current through itself, from the higher potential port to the lower. This leakage current is essentially the cause of this switching pop. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's say we have a <a href = "couplingCapacitor">coupling capacitor</a> in series with our input in order to add a <i>DC bias</i> to the AC signal. If we bypass the effect, we are leaving one leg of the capacitor 'floating' (disconnected), but the other leg is still connected to our biasing voltage. Initially, the floating leg will be at whatever potential the input was at when we disconnected (somewhere around \(0V\)). This potential difference forces the leakage current through the capacitor, gradually increasing the potential of the floating leg, until both legs are at the same potential (the biasing voltage). Our AC signal has a DC offset of \(0V\), and so when we switch the effect back on, there is a sudden rush of current through the load as the biasing voltage comes into contact with a much lower voltage, which is then amplified etc. and we hear that not-so-attractive pop.
					</p>
					<p>
						The solution to this is a pull-down resistor.
