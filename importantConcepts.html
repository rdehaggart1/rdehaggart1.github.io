				<h3>Important Concepts</h3>
				<p>
					Whilst this guide assumes a certain level of knowledge, there are some fundamental concepts that are really common and important in guitar effects pedals, and it's worth making sure we're all on the same page. At the end of this section, we'll disect the <i>MXR Distortion Plus</i>, and identify these key concepts. This will help us understand how this (and other pedals) do what they do to our playing!

				<div id = "grounding">
					<h4>Grounding</h4>
					<p style = "text-align: center">
						<b>Correctly grounding your circuits is important. Incorrect grounding can create a shock hazard. Please check your circuits thoroughly to make sure the grounding is adequate</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You're plugged in and ready to go, but there's an annoying buzzing noise that stops when you touch a metal part on the guitar body. If your parents paid extra to install that spectrum analyser in their child as the kind doctor recommended, you'll know that it's a \(50Hz\) or \(60Hz\) buzz. That's a <i>grounding issue</i>, my friend. What it means is that you have what's called a <i>ground loop</i> - when two parts of a circuit are supposed to be at the same electrical potential (\(0V\) in this case), but they're not. Often, audio equipment that is connected to the mains (an amplifier or effects pedal) will share the signal ground with the mains ground, and this means that the ground loop will actually pull the 'mains hum' into the signal, and amplify it (buzzzzz).
					</p>
					<p>
						Grounding issues are pretty easy to avoid, however. If ground is just a point with zero electrical potential, we just need to find something conductive with (theoretically) zero electrical potential that will not easily charge to some non-zero potential once current starts flowing in the circuit. It turns out that really any conveniently placed decent-sized solid peices of metal will do the trick nicely. For example, let's take a look inside a guitar for a second:

					<p>
						In circle (\(1.\)), you'll see the blob of solder mounted on the metallic body of a potentiometer. In circle (\(2.\)), you can (kind of) see a wire that dissapears away into the body of the guitar. This wire will connect to the bridge, or some other large piece of metal on the body. Both of these methods are as discussed above - <b>connect the circuit ground to large pieces of metal that will not easily increase their potential once current begins to flow</b>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In our circuits, potentiometers will be fairly common, and so we'll use those where possible. If we house our pedals in metal enclosures, we can connect to our chassis for grounding. If neither of these options are available, we should still be ok. We're still connected to the amplifier and the guitar grounds via the jack sockets and the jack plug <i>Sleeve</i> connections, and so as long as they've been grounded well, we should be alright... Wherever possible though, <b>please properly ground your circuits!!</b>

					<h4>Active or Passive?</h4>
						<p>
							This one is nice and simple. The circuits we'll look at will have both active and passive components. 
						</p>
						<p>
							A passive component is one that will only consume electrical power, and cannot produce any additional power of its own. Typically this just means that it does not have its own power supply (e.g. a resistor or an inductor).
						</p>
						<p>
							An active component has a power supply of its own (see <a href = "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-8/introduction-operational-amplifiers/" target = "_blank">operational amplifiers</a> for example). This means that it can draw power from this supply and 'inject' power into the circuit. The output of an op-amp can be much more powerful than it's input.
						</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "impedance">
					<h4>Impedance</h4>
						<p>
							Hopefully you have a decent grasp of <a href = "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-1/resistance/" target="_blank"><i>resistance</i></a>. <i>Impedance</i> is admittedly a little scarier (remember those imaginary numbers you thought you'd never need...). But for our purposes, the core takeaway is that <b>impedance is the effective resistance of a component to alternating current</b>. Remember how we said the vibration in the guitar string causes an alternating voltage level in your guitar circuitry? Perhaps it's obvious that this alternating voltage force pushes alternating current through the circuit, and so the impedance is a very important thing to understand and quantify. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Impedance is a combination of <i>resistance</i> and <i>reactance</i>. Resistors are our old friends! Of course, <i>resistors</i> are responsible for the <i>resistance</i> component of a circuit's impedance. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Reactance</i> is just a little bit messier. <i>Reactance</i> is the 'effective resistance' that is offered by components like <i>capacitors</i> and <i>inductors</i>. The reason that <i>reactance</i> isn't so friendly is that <b>reactance varies with frequency</b>. Don't worry too much about the maths right now, but it might help your understanding if you look at how a capacitors reactance is defined: \[X_C = {1 \over 2 \times \pi \times f \times C}\]
						</p>
						<p>
							A higher <i>reactance</i>, \(X\), is a higher <i>effective resistance</i>. <b>So for any particular capacitor, (characterised by it's <i>capacitance</i>, \(C\)), the reactance gets higher as the frequency, \(f\), of the alternating current decreases</b>. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If we have a \(10 \mu F\) capacitor (thats \({10 \over 1,000,000} F\)), then at the height of the human hearing range - \(20kHz\) - the reactance will be \(X_C \approx 0.8 \Omega \) - we could almost pretend the capacitor is just a bit of wire!
						</p>
						<p>
							A perfect direct current will not vary over time - it has a frequency of \(f=0Hz\). If we put this into our reactance equation, we get a divide-by-zero error (whoops!), but we can say that the reactance is essentially infinite for a direct current, as if there is an open circuit where the capacitor is - <b>a capacitor will 'block' direct currents</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Inductors are essentially the opposite in this sense. Their reactance increases as the frequency increases.

						Now that we have some understanding of impedance, we have to touch on a <b>VERY IMPORTANT THING</b>. As well as the impedance that exists all around our pedal circuitry, <b>we must also consider what is happening at the output of our guitar, and at the input of out amplifier!!!</b>
